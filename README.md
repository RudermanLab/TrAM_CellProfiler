# TrAM_CellProfiler
To install the `MeasureTrackQuality` plugin (which offers TrAM
functionality), first download CellProfiler Plugins from [here](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler-plugins/archive/master.zip) and unzip them
into a directory.

To enable the downloaded plugins, use the menu `Preferences >
CellProfiler plugins directory` within CellProfiler to specify the
directory you unzipped called `CellProfiler-plugins-master`. Restart CellProfiler. There should now be
an additional Module called `MeasureTrackQuality`.
